# 111d Proposed Power Plan rules Comments
The project represents a classification approach to assign positive/negative sentiment tags to publically submitted comments regarding propose regulations to existing power plans in the United States.  One of the primary purposes of the project was to demonstrate that a simple NLP bag of words model approach could be trained on a subset of public Federal regulation comments that could then be extrapolated to a population of comments that can number in the millions to quickly summarize sentiment among those commenting.  

Primary data source is the Regulations.gov site where a developer API key can be requested and data and supporting files.
